An experimental implementation of [Promises/A+](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec) for JavaScript.

Exports an AMD module if the ```define``` function is detected. If not, the module is assigned to the global context as ```After```.

If you have node.js installed you can execute the [Promises/A+ spec](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec) by running ```npm test``` at the console in the code folder.
